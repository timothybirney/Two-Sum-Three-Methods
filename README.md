# Two-Sum-Three-Methods

Here I introduce three ways to solve the Two Sum problem from Leet Code as described below. (Brute Force, Dictionary and Search)

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
